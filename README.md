This is the first website portfolio I've ever made! 
Happy to say this was the beginning of my coding journey :)

Built with HTML, CSS, and simple Javascript for dark mode. 
It is responsive in all the devices I've opened it with.
You can visit anytime you feel like feeding virtual fishies: https://shabirara.github.io/

It contains my CV per August 2021.
